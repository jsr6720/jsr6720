For others that don't have eating disorders, but do suffer from emotion and reward trigger based eating, food almost controls every aspect of life. These highly emotional responses to food come from habits formed over a lifetime. Kessler also observes that caloric intake does not follow homeostasis response. This 'set-point' theory is why persistent pounds are the hardest to shed. Not the first 5lbs but the last 5lbs.<br/><br/>Fat, salt, and sugar. The trifecta of combination triggers reward centers in the mind that lead to cravings that are past the homeostasis maintaining body fat.<br/><br/>Part One of this book primarily focuses on the brain interaction with habit forming emotional stimulus.

Without this background knowledge of two system brain Kessler skims over some of the more nuanced brain terminology.<br/><br/>Conclusion of part one: objective driven behaviors 'I want ice cream' will quickly become habit behaviors 'why am I always craving ice cream when I get home from work'. To control eating you must engage the top down part of the brain. If anticipation of food causes dopamine/oxycodone response this is a habit. If hunger is the motivator it is an objective.<br/><br/>Part two and added to much of the literature is a study on how food scientists design their foods to hit each area of the food 'compass' (fat, salt, sugar). this typically means butter/oils, sugar (not refined, but molasses, brown sugar), salt. Another observation is restaurant industry tries to make food ultra-palatable. By using binding agents food is easier to chew so more can be consumed in one sitting. Advertising is based around the emotional responses to food.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems in today's society is greed of corporations and accessibility of foods.

LinkedIn allows you to expense these lunches if you provide a brief on the 'competition'. Start an alumni network (McKinsey firm is notorious about this). Great people leave for bigger and better opportunities but they can provide value to their starter bases. Another good idea was to engage a workforce ""one project/stint"" at a time. Don't talk about family, everyone know that's not genuine. Don't talk about short term. Engage employees at 1-2 yearly stints, then pull them into the fold at 3-5 years and then promote them as senior leaders. None of these have to be concurrent.

So regardless of how fair the blue ocean appears operations need to continue to compete today.<br/><br/>The truth is obscurity is the biggest problem. There are literal billions or at least hundreds of millions of customers not event targeted by strategic research for the taking. Ironically the thing utilized most for red-sea analysis is market research. But this really only mirrors back the expectations users have for existing offerings, and tends to reflect ""more for less"" type of incremental innovations.<br/><br/>When enacting new strategies do not violate the three E's of justice.

The kid who gets an extra hour of practice a day * 10 years in school results in a master.<br/><br/>On the circumstance front, there are macro-level forces that can favor groups. Ie the lull in birth rates during the depression meant that children of that era had access to far more high-quality opportunities than generations on each side. As they grew up teacher-student ratios were low, as they took jobs entry level labor was in demand and as they took leadership of industries they were in competition with few others. This does NOT diminish the hard work it took to accomplish, it merely observes that hard work applied with greater leverage results in greater accomplishments.<br/><br/>Finally the book delves deep into how cultures rank on Hofstede's cultural dimensions. I was unfamiliar with this and his most famous dimension ""power distance indicator"". Anyways the message of this book isn't 'look at how these elite few have succeeded' but more optimistically 'look at the ways we can provide opportunity to more people to grow humanity'. This concept was briefly discussed in [book:The 80/20 Principle|181206]. In life your goal should be to draw as many 'opportunities' as possible. Some are out of your control, era and location of birth, pedigree, socio-economic upbringing, but many are within your control. Of those that are in your control in the words of [author:John C.

Closely adheres to the text though. The book was originally published in 2001, and the author has added some notes in recording the book in 2005. Not all companies are born ""Great"". This book is the study of the principles that unite the good to great companies. A quick caveat. Two of the companies studied were Circuit City and Fannie Mae. It is important to note that becoming great can lead to arrogance. Just as sports dynasties come and go, we can still learn from studying the heyday years of disciplined who, disciplined thought, and disciplined action.<br/><br/>""Good is the enemy of great"". It is very easy to stay 'good' and not achieve greatness. Great companies have a ""Level 5 Leader"" at the helm. Someone who exemplifies all the great qualities of leadership and is humble, stoic, resolved in his decision making. This book is organized into three sections, Disciplined Who, Disciplined Thought, Disciplined Action. The right people will manage themselves. The right people will listen to the right ideas. The right people can enact the right actions.<br/><br/>""Who, then What"". Get the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right spots. THEN determine the strategy, tactical, operational, etcetera. It's much easier to get a group of the right people to go a different direction than to take the wrong people in a different direction. Thinking of ""Him and Haw"" from [b:Who Moved My Cheese?|4894|Who Moved My Cheese?|Spencer Johnson|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388639717s/4894.jpg|3332594]. Level 5 leaders also have a 'window and mirror' approach to success and failure. They look in the mirror when failure occurs, and point out the window to external factors for successes. A deep talent pool is critical for the enduring success of a company.<br/><br/>""Leave a lasting legacy."" This is the truest measure of success for a leader. In fact Covey and others identify it as a core desire of any great leader. Level 4 leaders are great, but their organizations falter without them at the helm. In articles they are far more likely to use ""I"" statements, instead of ""we"". Think ""genius with a hundred helpers"". This genius has no desire to develop talent, and in fact will openly squash it. Setting up any successful for failure. In fact this chapter reminded me most of my time at Flower City Printing under my boss. He was an expert in his fiefdom but refused to hire any talent that could exceed his knowledge.<br/><br/>10/11 good to great companies had internal candidates attain CEO position. On average, great CEOs take home slightly less cash compensation than good CEOs. However compensation is not the key motivator for Level 5 leaders. Like so many other works, focus on the outcome of the organization, on accomplishments and success, and the money will find you. From the books on military strategy, you must never underestimate a man's resolve. Level 5 leaders have resolve that transcends compensation incentives. See Steve Jobs $1 annual salary.<br/><br/>Great leaders also are unafraid to take the hard actions, confronting the brutal facts. As one CEO who survived cancer put it. ""If the cancer is in the arm, have the courage to amputate the arm"". Walgreens invented the malt shake, and had a long history of food service, but the CEO saw this as a distraction from it's core drug-store business. He set a course that removed this core part of the business. Be the 'plow horse' not the 'show horse'. A big focus on WHO means when evaluating people be rigorous not ruthless. Also, try moving the people around the organization several times before settling on termination.<br/><br/>Put the best and brightest on the best opportunities, not the worst problems. Great companies solidify around a core ""hedgehog"" concept. Their decision making supports this hedgehog. Confront the brutal facts. Having the right people will bring the brutal facts to bear. Being optimistic is not the same as being realistic (stockdale paradox). Have the courage and unyielding determination that you will prevail, but don't forget to face the facts. Reminds me of the phrase ""don't forget to fly the plane"". An airliner went down because all the experts (pilots) focused on one gauge/error in the cockpit. Nobody flew the plane.<br/><br/>Technology is an accelerant, but not the cause of great changes. In the study of good to great companies 80% of executives did NOT list technology at all as a factor in their transformation. First who, then what. The focus on building a great company is a study of the three circles of your hedgehog concept (what you are passionate about, what you can be best in the world at, what drives your economic engine). None of those require technology. Granted you cannot be a laggard, but parity with competitors is often all that is necessary. Systems of innovation should be invested in what drives the economic engine and propels you to greatness. For example, a steel plant should have a sufficient system of record (accounting), but pioneer the most efficient way to produce steel per ton.<br/><br/>Finding the best 'denominator' to measure a company's hedgehog concept is crucial. This isn't a wall street measure (profit per earnings, or profit per shares), but something like ""profit per customer visit"" or ""profit per thousand pounds of finished product"". From buildup to breakthrough, coverage of a company focuses on the transformation effect. Think when the chicken emerges from the egg. What a stupendous event we think, but to the chicken it's just another step. This also expands on the fly-wheel concept. All changes will turn the flywheel, the key is to consistently make the push in the same direction to build momentum.<br/><br/>Most importantly. Crawl, Walk, Run. You cannot buy or acquire into greatness. Two mediocre companies cannot combine to greatness. You do not need an outside charismatic leader to make all the changes. The single most important message of this book is first who, then what. With the right people on the bus formulating success becomes an act of passion that will not be stopped.",,,1,0

Collins|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1435813395s/76865.jpg|1094028]. This book focuses on companies that have endured over the long haul and become a fabric of the american consciousness. Think 3M, P&G, WalMart. These 'great' companies are classified as 'visionary companies' and aren't marked by trouble-free pasts, but persistence.<br/><br/>Myth: Great companies are founded by Great Ideas. (Good to Great concept: first who then what).<br/>Companies founded with a great idea can become too attached to the idea instead of having a passion of delivering value outside the organization. Organizations don't have one charismatic leader, but rather a group of people that tackle b-hags (big hairy audacious goals). B-hags need to get the ""juices flowing"". They should stand on their own since they often transcend leaders. Think moon mission, JFK set the goal in 1961, was assassinated in 1963 and we still made it to the moon before the decade was out.<br/><br/>Myth: Great companies require a strong charismatic leader. (Good to great concept: genius with helpers fallacy)<br/>In the research strong leaders were negatively correlated with visionary companies. These strong leaders would often give no thought to talent grooming or succession planning. This works only so long as the 'genius' is in charge of the company. See related concept ""Building a clock vs telling time"" below.<br/><br/>Great companies are founded with goals broader than making profit. Often great companies will undergo projects that benefit mankind but might not have a direct bottom dollar ROI. These are done because they fit the core mission of the company. Merck and J&J were founded to alleviate the ills of mankind. Merck took to market and gave away a drug that causes river blindness because ""it would demoralize the scientist if all they worked for was profit"". Once b-hags are accomplished they should be replaced with more b-hags or companies will plateau with ""we've arrived"" syndrome.<br/><br/>Concept: Build a clock, not time telling<br/>A genius leader can tell the time, but great leaders build a companies with tangible mechanisms that will persist long after their departure. Key concept here is to introduce tangible mechanisms that keep the process going in a positive direction. P&G introduced an internal 'brand' structure that ensured divisions did not rest on their laurels. Other companies had mechanisms that ensured the ""we've arrived"" mentality did not settle in. By this process these companies are NOT comfortable places to work.<br/><br/>Concept: Preserve the core, AND stimulate progress.<br/>Yin and Yang of business is pragmatism with realistic. Dump the tyranny of the 'or'. Embrace the power of 'and'. Not short term gain OR long term value, both. Identify the core ideologies of the company, change everything else. Values/Ideology should be clear and easily communicable. This is something that founders often ""feel"" is core to their beliefs. (Good to great concept: Stockdale paradox. The undying belief you will prevail combined with facing the brutal facts of reality). <br/><br/>How does this fit with having a single hedgehog concept? There are two types of hedgehogs. Process driven, concept driven. Be the best at a manufacturing process (Gillette) or be the best at innovation (3M). Internally succession planning is crucial element of ensuring leadership continuity. The ""doom"" loop is introduced here (Good to Great concept opposite of The Flywheel). The doom loop is failure, followed by crises, followed by search for external savior. External savior brings in his own people, highly talented core people leave further weakening the company.<br/><br/>The core concept in Built to Last is ""preserve the core, stimulate progress"". Creating a meaningful company is about having a strong vision, identifying a core purpose, a reason why your business exists besides maximizing shareholder profits. In fact many of the built to last companies identify shareholder profit as a priority, but not the most important priority. Core values, with a clear defined purpose needs to be instituted down the entire organization. This cannot be fake, people know fake when they see it. The findings indicate the single most important decision is staffing an organization with high caliber people who are driven to continuously improve.",,,1,0

The book is focused on great leaders of the 'modern' era which is primarily western focused and post 18th century. Great leadership is when the leader is transparent. At the end a group of men will think, 'we did this'. Great leaders delegate to trusted subordinates. They are passionate and resolved.<br/><br/>3 schools of thought on great leaders: 'trait' based (white men, over 40 who attended west point). 'behavior' based (meticulous, stoic, brave) and 'circumstances' based (no great men, ordinary men forged in extraordinary circumstances). Great generals also blend leading with intelligence and leading with heart. War is not just won on the battlefield. War is ""99% boredom punctuated by moments of sheer hell"". As described in ""The American Revolution"" lecture just keeping a standing army is quite a feat.<br/><br/>2 schools of thought on military history: 'great men' theory, ie Generals win the war, and 'common man' theory. Boots on the ground soldiers are responsible for the winning of wars. Best history (the study of change over time) blends narratives of both. For the best generals win by advancing three fronts: tactical, strategic, objective. It's said that amateurs study strategy, great generals study logistics. As shown by quartermasters Nathaniel Green in the revolutionary war and US Grant in the American-Mexican war. In fact until WWI more troops die of camp fever (dysentery, infection) and other diseases than do of actual combat.<br/><br/>Introduction is very good overview of historical western wars.

The lecture described how different generals 'looked the part' and others 'blended in' but regardless of mannerisms all practiced the principle ""to protect peace, prepare for war"". Many great generals were also great trainers. They were not afraid to delegate and trust subordinates, and were wary of 'number crunching' the way through war. ",,,1,0

Our biology fights it. Often casual conversations morph into crucial ones. A crucial conversation is one where stakes are high, opinions vary, emotions are charged. Need open communication to have a successful endeavor (family/corporate). Silence kills, holding back from the truth harms both yourself and the party impacted.<br/><br/>Most often casual conversations turn into critical ones. These are not the types of conversations you can rehearse or prepare for. Three outcomes of these types of conversations: foul it up, avoid it, do it right. The fool's choice (false dilemma) is that it's either be honest or hurt yourself. IE be honest with the boss is career suicide.<br/><br/>Crucial conversations are the results of free flowing information from each individual's 'pool of meaning'. Start with the heart and get understanding onto the table. Dialog is the results of good conversational skills. Two things kill dialog: silence and violence. Trying to force meaning into the shared pool of meaning (violence) or withholding from the shared pool (silence) kills fruitful dialog. Good dialog is the free flowing exchange of meaning between parties.<br/><br/>Best dialog people are keenly aware of the changing situation. They see when others no longer feel safe to contribute to the pool of meaning. When emotions run high they are able to step back and ask themselves ""What do I want to accomplish"". Much of this book is active listening in practice. Another aspect of crucial conversations is avoiding ""Villain, victim, and helpless"" stories. All of these tales leave out ""the rest of the story"" usually our own part in the predicament. 'My boss is a micro-manager' (but I've missed several key deliverable) is a villain story.<br/><br/>Capture the actions from a conversation. ""Who will do what, by when and follow-up"". Know that not all crucial conversations have consensus, but that all do have actionable traits. If you are having the 'same' crucial conversation again and again, it's time to change the message. It's not ""you broke curfew again"" now it's ""you failed to honor your commitment"". ",,,1,0

I was deeply affected by just listening to it, and it's sadness knew no limit, for even liberation was met with death.<br/><br/>This book is two parts, a first hand account of the Holocaust as experienced by the author, and it's influence in founding the branch of psychology known as 'logotherapy'. The book was originally written in German and was titled roughly ""Nevertheless saying 'yes' to life"". Listening to the first hand account of 'camp life' is incredibly hard. Frankl narrates that the best men died quickly, they did not survive this experience.<br/><br/>The points I took from this are:<br/>* Man with a 'why' to live can endeavor almost any 'how'<br/>* Stripped of everything man is left with one freedom. The choice to respond to his condition<br/>* the ""meaning"" of life is fulfilling the existential void that exists in every man.

Introduce the faintest light source and they will struggle for 3-4 times longer).<br/><br/>Mankind is made of 'decent' and 'indecent' men. Society cannot exist without both types of men. The most noble end was to meet death with dignity. Reminds me of the famous photo ""Last Jew of Vinnitsa"".<br/><br/>The second part of the book was 'ok' but did not match the power of the first hand account of camp life. Some of the concepts from logotherapy are primarily about mindset. ""Don't think about the success you want to achieve, but about the achievements you want to accomplish. Success will follow"".<br/><br/>""The best men did not return"". Frankl observed first hand that there were those who would not compromise on their morals. They met death rather than bend.<br/>These included men who gave their food rations to others, and refused to inflict violence at the behest of ""kapos"" or SS Guards. The ""best"" men being those who would not put down others to ensure their own survival.<br/><br/>The most important part of the book. Life never ceases to have meaning. There are three ways to attain meaning<br/>* Creating a work or doing a deed<br/>* Experience and Love. Think nature's beauties, the <br/>* Through unavoidable suffering.

This book focuses on the 'gut' reaction that people have to stimulus. System 1 has the ability to categorize and respond to patterns before the top down System 2 can even understand what is happening. Opening chapter cites John Gottman's work ([b:The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert|849380|The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work  A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert|John M. Gottman|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1320521960s/849380.jpg|4370]) and how this is a study of ""thin slices"" approach. By categorizing every second of an interaction with a variety of codes and measures a clear pattern emerges that then predicts marriage outcome.<br/><br/>Since this rapid cognition happens in milliseconds it is hidden from our conscious thoughts. In fact it's a 'locked door' that we can only filter not change. This rapid response has a dark side. When dealing with negative associations things can escalate out of control. IE President william harding. No qualifications other than he 'looked the part'. Or negative associations with minority races. Black -> bad, white -> good.<br/><br/>Thin slicing also has another downfall. Too much information. Our top-down brain likes and expects more information to be more 'confident' of a decision. But that's all it builds: confidence. Another scenario that thin slicing is valid is when time is a constrained resource. Ideally you'd have infinite time, infinite resources to come to a conclusion. Under duress system 1 takes over and hands up a snap decision that if not trusted can lead to remorse. This book again builds on the System 1 concepts of [b:Thinking, Fast and Slow|11468377|Thinking, Fast and Slow|Daniel Kahneman|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1317793965s/11468377.jpg|16402639]. Good read.<br/><br/>Another side effect of snap judgements is object transference. We see a chair and judge it to be comfortable by how it conforms to our preconceived notions of what a chair should be. This also applies to product purchases. Packaging is the product and can impact perceptions. 7-up was tested in a 'yellower' can and users reported the product had a strong lime taste.<br/><br/>Another aspect of 'blink' is the human ability to read another person's face in thin slicing approach. Things like ""why are you mad"" or ""why are you sad"" when you feel like you're putting on your best game face. Face is not just a residual of feelings it's also the involuntary expression of feelings. Playing videos at quarter speed shows these emotions plainly. This is how Gottman can categorize relationships in 15 min. Take a contextual sample, an argument, and categorize all the emotions by type and you're left with an 'fist' of pattern matching.<br/><br/>This is how teletype operators were tracked via WWII. Operators come online and use the telegraph morse code in their own sub-conscious way. This could be picked up by another human. The most important aspect of all these categorizations are occurring in a 'context'. Interactions between couples at dinner parties is not relevant. Gottman has his couples discuss a point of contention/disagreement in their marriage to set the proper context.<br/><br/>The final section of the book deals with how police officers handle rapid cognition in interactions. Much of their training is built around protecting the brain from feeling trapped. During the heightened awareness the body will actually start shutting down extraneous systems. People became 'autistic' in the sense they overly focus on objects instead of faces. Police officers involved in shootings describe only focusing on the gun, the hand and being totally un-aware of any other activity. The body performs 'best' in these high stress situations at a heart rate around 120-150 bmp. More and the body is overwhelmed, less and its taxing but not effective.<br/><br/>In conclusion, knowing what your brain does in the 2 seconds after you encounter a stimulus is important but cannot block prejudices. With the rise of 'screened' orchestra auditions for example orchestras have become much more diverse in minorities and females. While our top down system asserts that we are masters of perception and can identify great talent from our ears alone, like the drinkers of 7-up our eyes form judgements about what we see which influence what we think.",,,1,0

So glad I picked this up on Amazon.<br/>This book focuses on the advances in Cognitive Dissonance (CD) in the last 15 years. <br/>CD is the engine of self-justification. CD is the meeting of two contrasting ideals. I.e. smoking is bad, I smoke, but it's ok because I smoke to keep the weight off and being obese is bad.<br/><br/>CD also warps reality to self affirming views (see bias heuristics [b:Thinking, Fast and Slow|11468377|Thinking, Fast and Slow|Daniel Kahneman|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1317793965s/11468377.jpg|16402639]). Classic example Aesop's fable the fox and the grapes. On not being able to reach the grapes alas the grapes are sour anyways. These biases/blind spots shape human interaction, and contrary to all the apologies to the contrary, lowered inhibition increases honest speaking. I.e. ""I can't believe I would have said that last night"" while drinking in actually means ""My personal bias/prejudice was exposed and I reject that"". This is classic CD and the brain covers up by blaming the substance.<br/><br/>CD is the brain-child of Leon Festinger. Consonant dissonance relationships are ones that are congruent with our currently held beliefs. The harder and more trials/tribulations a person's WILLINGLY subjected themselves too the more they adhere to the belief. I.e. the young person who joins a Fraternity with a harsh hazing initiation will justify the hazing as part of inclusion.<br/><br/>CD is an evolutionary trait, imagine every good/bad decision playing out indefinitely in your mind. CD will, over time, blunt the mistakes and emphasize the 'good' of any situation (nostalgia). This allows people to buy a house in the suburbs over the trendy loft in the city and seek affirming evidence. ""I always wanted a yard"".<br/><br/>CD can help explain human behavior that is not accounted for by behavioral or economic incentives. In addition to the smoker who continues to smoke in the face of fiscal cost of smoking, the social cost of being an outcast. Take the religious hospitals that close over the CD they experience when required to provide abortions. A rational agent economic model and social good model do not account for the hospital closing.<br/><br/>Good metaphor on pyramid of decision. At top easy to go one way or another. Until you slide to the bottom and you've internalized beliefs. Ask betters their confidence interval before and after placing bets on ponies and confidence increases nearly to certainty after finality of decision. Don't just ask someone who has made the decision. Ask someone who is in the throes of evaluation.<br/><br/>Brain has evolved to have bias towards self. I.e. I'm a rational person. Therefor any idea I hold is rational. The other person with an opposing view is wrong, if only they would listen to me I could explain why. An individual has introspection to 'back up' a belief. No such mechanism exists for others. Take the stance ""I know gun control to be effective because I've held that belief for years"" and the comically opposite ""They can't be trusted to be objective because they've held their gun control belief for years"".<br/><br/>Brain is always categorizing things. Evolutionary trait that allowed early humans to quickly distinguish prey from predator, poison from nourishment. This same 'category' system is the precursor to prejudice (added book The nature of prejudice) which when cannot be corrected with evidence is the basis of bigotry. Categories is how our brain sorts 'us' and 'them'. During times of plentiful 'us' and 'them' co-exists. During times of duress people retreat to 'their' respective groups. See internment of Japanese during WWII, or bullying of kids in other cliques.<br/><br/>The best way to make a friend. Have them do you a favor. Upon doing a favor for someone that person experience dissonance that they explain by saying ""He's a good guy"". I'm a rational person and would not do something nice for him unless he was deserving.<br/><br/>Book offers some interesting insight into history on the history and deregulation of pharmaceutical industry. How scientist used to receive funding from independent sources, but now pump out drugs that have dubious if questionable benefits. Why risk integrity and reputation? Because the scientist/politician has slid to the bottom of the pyramid and can see no wrong with the incremental changes he has internalized.<br/><br/>$10 word from the book: ""confabulate"" which is a memory disturbance, specifically recalling a memory without the intent to lie. Ego-centric mind will adjust memory in most flattering light. Memory is like a totalitarian dictator. Rejects things that don't match. Adjust things that do to be self evident. Book goes on a binge of stories backing this claim. Authors of ""Million Little Pieces"" and ""Fragments"" guilty of a thousand narrative changes that ended with a novel and their downfall. See also Brian Williams and Hillary Clinton in their respective 'duress under fire' narratives.<br/><br/>From 5->4. First three chapters were phenomenal. After that it goes on a deep dive into real world examples. Again not a negative, but seemed diverge from the science of the brain to narration. I experienced dissonance as I felt the book would be more about the brain than application in the real world. Full chapter on expert confidence bias and how this leads police/prosecutors to imprison innocent people. How these 'innocents' tend to have less than stellar bios so it's easy to justify 'testi-lying'.<br/><br/>Surprise surprise, full chapter on how the brain adjust to divorce by rewriting memories. Book cites Dr. Gottman (see [b:The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert|849380|The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work  A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert|John M. Gottman|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1320521960s/849380.jpg|4370] work). This book asserts that self justification starts couples down the path of contempt. Once memories are rewritten such that there is no happiness in the past, it's easy to justify divorce.<br/><br/>The book ended on nice summary of keeping our watchful eye on our brains processes. Reminding readers to not second guess every decision, but to remember that admitting fault will garner the most sincerity in others.",,,1,0

Author offers a new measure of wealth: not the showmanship of flash purchases, but the expected net worth value based on age and income. Flashy spenders tend to have low reserves of money, or as a Texans says ""All hat and no cattle"". (UAW) under-accumulator of wealth<br/><br/>Book originally published in 1996 so fiscal data seems dated. Also their studies are biased towards the type of thrifty millionaires that would accept money to take an hours long survey. Heavy emphasis on frugal, thriftiness and living within means. Having a ""go to hell fund"" that can last the individual 10 or more years without any additional earned income.<br/><br/>7 factors of PAW: <br/>1. live well below their means (save at least 20% per annum)<br/>2. Allocate time, energy, money efficiently. Planning, budgeting, cash flow.<br/>3. Believe in financial independence more than displaying wealth. Shop at JCPenney for off the rack suits<br/>4. Parents did not give them lots of money<br/>5. Children are not dependent as adults<br/>6. Proficient at targeting opportunities. Business and stock<br/>7. Choose the right occupation<br/><br/>First few chapters in and have noted that while bread-winners (typically men) play great offense at building wealth. Many report that their wives are more frugal than they. This great defense keeps the money and builds wealth. Another note is the ""dull-boring"" nature of much of the wealth building strategies: discipline, frugality, dedication, hard-work.<br/><br/>Book heavily focuses on how accumulating wealth is primarily a lifestyle focus. Stay away from luxury brands and you'll do better. Another interesting observation is that many first-generation wealthy individuals started their own business, but they do not want that hardship for their children. So they pay for higher education and encourage their kids to enter professions of service. Think CPA/Finance, Lawyer, Dentist/Doctor. In the words of one millionaire who survived the Holocaust: ""They can take your equipment, land, and money, but they cannot take your intellect"". Or as I've heard ""Knowledge never burdens you and you can give it away and still retain it"".<br/><br/>Not as many 'hard' facts for a finance book. The section I found most interesting was how to transfer wealth from one generation to the next. The single most important investment is an education. After that children of wealthy individuals would do better to foster an independent life, free of economic outpatient care (EOC). Children who grow up and cannot see the difference between their parents wealth and their own set up for lifelong fiscal sustenance problems.<br/><br/>This book reminded me a lot of advice that my grandfather had given me over the years. Several times I swore it was him speaking and not the narrator. Later focus good on disseminating wealth obtained by being a PAW in the later chapters of the book. It's certainly worth reading and recommending, but the heavy injection of 1996 finance dates the book.",,,1,0
