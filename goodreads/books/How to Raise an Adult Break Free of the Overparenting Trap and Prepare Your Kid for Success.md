## My Review

Did not like nor did I finish. Judging from the other reviews, the bulk of the book is anecdotal and preaching from the elite upper-middle class problems. To be the freshman dean of Stanford and say colleges don't matter is a tough sell. To live in the safe confines of Palo Alto and say 'let your children roam' is a tough sell.<br/><br/>This book is beyond long that is accomplished by [b:How Much Is Enough?|157936|How Much Is Enough?  Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Ch|Jean Illsley Clarke|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348181967s/157936.jpg|152422] or [b:Boundaries with Kids|40930550|Boundaries with Kids|Dr. Henry / Townsend, Dr. John Cloud|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1532379460s/40930550.jpg|63808654]. For sure skip the LONG introduction and focus on the second half of the book if you're looking for practical tips to implement.
