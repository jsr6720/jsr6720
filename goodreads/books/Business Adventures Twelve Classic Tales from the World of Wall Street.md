## My Review

As famously recommended by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, this was a very entertaining read. In fact I wish there were a modern version. Two things struck me, the way I consume news is author independent. I should change this. Finding a good author like Malcolm Gladwell, John Covey, or Jim Collins is just as important as reading the 'highlight' real of best books.<br/><br/>The story that stuck with me most was "Xerox Xerox Xerox" and the story of the "Edsel" Ford brand. Xerox because I now work in Webster, the 'cow town' that xerox was setting up headquarters in 1960s.<br/><br/>This book, I think is far more relevant to those who lived through the time period. Identifying with the subject matter is important.
