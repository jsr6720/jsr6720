## My Review

Finkel matches maslow's hierarchy of needs to the marriage.<br/><br/>The higher elevations are hard to attain with one partner, but knowing that you can come off the peak to summit another day helps all interactions.<br/><br/>Also forming a partnership dynamic that does what's right for the couple and not what society deems appropriate helps tremendously.<br/><br/>There is a tremendous amount of data in this book as well that covers every happiness scenario within hetero-sexual couples. Great expansion on the topics covered in [b:Ten Lessons to Transform Your Marriage|634227|Ten Lessons to Transform Your Marriage  America's Love Lab Experts Share Their Strategies for Strengthening Your Relationship|John M.
