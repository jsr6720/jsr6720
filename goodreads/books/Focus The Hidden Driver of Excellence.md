## My Review

Not as good or informative as his [b:Emotional Intelligence|26329|Emotional Intelligence  Why It Can Matter More Than IQ|Daniel Goleman|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388185411s/26329.jpg|587647] book. Lots of repetition. Seems like book could be one chapter. Focus. it's good for you. The second half of the book improves greatly.<br/><br/>Final thoughts, this book really warmed up after the second half. Visionary leadership depends on focus on execution.
