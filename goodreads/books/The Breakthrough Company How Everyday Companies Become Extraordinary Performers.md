Making a company a place where employees WANT to work is far more important than fiefdoms.<br/><br/>Build the culture - building a company that outlast a visionary is key. This has been covered in more depth with [b:Built to Last|4122|Built to Last  Successful Habits of Visionary Companies|James C.

Remember being loyal to an employee can hamper the growth of an organization.
