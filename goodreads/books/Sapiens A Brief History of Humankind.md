## My Review

Great book. I cannot do it justice with the below takeaways.<br/><br/>Honestly it sneaked up on me that it was also a commentary book about how little our biology relates to our current social order. The first 1/3 of the book is very good, but once you get to the post-modern historical era brace yourself for lots of skimming and/or sweeping judgments on humanity.<br/><br/>Humans have relatives: Neanderthals and Erect-us that died out/purged?<br/>Humans have destroyed every ecology it's touched<br/><br/>Traversing through the three revolutions: Cognitive, Agriculture, Scientific/Technology, Sapiens have shaped the world with the one true revolution. Being able to lie/tell about a fantasy that isn't there.<br/><br/>These religions permeate all aspects of our culture. The shared myths allow us to extend our network beyond the 'tribe' onto the whole world.<br/><br/>The book ends depressingly enough with one of three outcomes<br/>1. ecological/nuclear disaster<br/>2. transform into cyber beings<br/>3. AI takes over the world<br/>4. Genetic engineering takes over the world
