Popkin|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348008401s/1343214.jpg|1332807] are far superior choices to this book.<br/><br/>In short here are three lessons when dealing with primarily toddler and early elementary school aged children:<br/><br/>* Don't dismiss feelings<br/>* Have the kid be an active participant in their world<br/>* As better described in the boundaries book above. Allow kids to experience natural consequences over punishment.<br/>
