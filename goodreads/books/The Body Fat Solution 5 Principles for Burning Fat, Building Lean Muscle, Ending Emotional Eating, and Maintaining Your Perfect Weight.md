## My Review

This is a great a book that blends the life approach of "Think and Grow Rich" with the way the mind works with eating. Lots of good advice.<br/><br/>To say it only focuses on food, diet and exercise is selling the book short. Really dives deep on mindset needed for long term healthy living.
