## My Review

Good book that covers the years leading up to President Lincolns assassination. Though the title led me to believe this book would be more about cabinet decisions it was ultimately a discussion of how Lincoln balanced the various egos and political ambitions of those in his cabinet.<br/><br/>I wish it had spent a little more time on how the cabinet fared after the death of Lincoln. Still a good book.
