## My Review

Full disclosure I couldn't bring myself to finish this book beyond the introduction. McKeown does the reader a great service and summarizes his main points in the introduction. I found the [b:The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less|181206|The 80/20 Principle  The Secret to Achieving More with Less|Richard Koch|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437557431s/181206.jpg|175093] a far superior book in both backing information (Pareto principle) and writing style.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you haven't read "The 80/20 Principle" this book is as follows:<br/>* Find the vital few things that you are passionate about and can do the most to further<br/>* Say no to everything else<br/><br/>There are many approaches to deciding on this. Some other books that touch on this include [b:Eat That Frog!|95887|Eat That Frog!  21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time|Brian Tracy|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328854785s/95887.jpg|2203492] and [b:Who Moved My Cheese?|4894|Who Moved My Cheese?|Spencer Johnson|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388639717s/4894.jpg|3332594]. I'm not saying this book is poor, just that with the above reading it's repetitive.
