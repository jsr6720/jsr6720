## My Review

I picked this book because I felt out of touch with all the block chain technologies out there. This book did a good job covering the foundation of fiat currencies and the future of digital ones.<br/><br/>However, be aware that this book covers much more ground that Bitcoin itself. It will be interesting to see how digital currencies play out. Reminded me of the stories in [b:Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street|22710212|Business Adventures  Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street|John Brooks|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1405215406s/22710212.jpg|4238490]
