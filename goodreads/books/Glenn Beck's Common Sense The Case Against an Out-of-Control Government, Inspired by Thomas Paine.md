## My Review

Picked this book up because I read an article about Beck's remorse over Trump's victory.<br/>Bonus: This book includes the original text of Thomas Pains Common Sense.<br/><br/>Here are my key takeaways:<br/><br/>* Back a politician not a party.<br/>* Use the tools of democracy to change the system. Violence is not needed<br/>* Redistricting as a political tool is killing democracy<br/>* Active informed citizens are required for a representative republic<br/><br/>
