## My Review

Ugh. this book spends the first half setting up the most unrealistic scenario for changing company culture. All you need is the son of a successful executive with a film degree and mild OCD that causes him to blurt out things..<br/><br/>In summary (look at agile methodology which is now all the rage)<br/>1. All meetings need conflict to have meaningful resolution<br/>2. There are 4 major types of meetings<br/>  a. Daily stand up -> 5min brief update<br/>  b. Weekly tactical -> 1-2 hours that review status of initiatives with score cards and metrics<br/>  c. Monthly strategic -> 3-4 hours that tackle major strategic moves.<br/>  d. off site retreats -> 1-3 days of deep thinking and team-building. Of business nature.<br/>3. Take votes before and after to determine standings<br/>4. Need strong leader to drive discussion and mine for conflict<br/><br/>All this wrapped in a heavy TV headline news -> sitcom -> drama hour -> miniseries -> movie metaphor. This book could be summarized as a pamphlet in my opinion.
