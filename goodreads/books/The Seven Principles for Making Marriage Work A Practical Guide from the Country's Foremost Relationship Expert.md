## My Review

Great book with lots of functional examples and test for 'scoring' a marriage.<br/>Key is a solid friendship that can weather the storm of life.<br/><br/>Learn to respect each other's differences and move past gridlock issues. Will definitely pick up again,<br/>need physical book to copy some of the exercises.
