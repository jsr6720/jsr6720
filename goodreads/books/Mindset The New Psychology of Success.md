## My Review

This book is a collection of studies around two types of mindsets. "Growth" mindset and "Fixed" mindset. <br/><br/>Abandoned this book after the first few chapters (cds). It is literally the same topic over and over. "growth" is good, "fixed" is bad. Followed by a different example cited in literature.<br/><br/>Fixed mindsets believe that their worth is a measure of any one moment in time. Whereas growth mindset believe that anything can be improved with practice and effort. Growth is not mislead into thinking everyone can achieve the pinnacle of success in a chosen field, only that one failure does not define them.
